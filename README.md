## Project goals ##

Supply a website that woman who have hormonal related issues, like problems with fertility, menstruation and sexuality and more general life questions can go to and get information and book appointments for sessions so they can start getting healthier again.

## UX ##

### User Goals ###

- The website has to work well on all kind of devices like mobile phones, tables and desktops
- The login procedure should be clear and feedback should be given when appropriate
- The registration process should be clear, easy to do and feedback should be given when appropriate
- The website has to be easy to use and easy to update information
- Visually appealing website

### Scope ###

An easy to navigate and responsive website that is fun to use and allows users as well as site owners, to perform CRUD operations. Users can sign up and, once logged in, the can either buy products or book appointments. These users manage their purchases and bookings, meaning they can edit and delete them when they want.
Also, they can update their password and username and even delete their account.

## Structure of the website ##

### View for a guest user ###

A user that is not logged in and/or registered, will see a homepage with information about the various sessions that are offered, workshops that will be given and a shop where session related products can be bought. They will also see a sign in and sign up button.
On all pages where services or products are offered, they are prompted to register/login to benefit from these futures. They can also subscribe to a newsletter.

### View for logged in user ###

A logged in user will benefit from the full functionality of the site. The navigation will contain extra: 'Logout'.
This user is able to book appointments, book workshops and buy products they might need for exercises given in sessions.
In the profile there are also functions for changing once username, password and even delete their account.

### User Stories ###

Because there are many user stories for this project, I have made a spreadsheet containing different levels of users (client and user) as well as the stories for the shop owner.
This fill is by no means complete. During development there might be some added or removed, depending on functionality and usability.

View the stories [here](https://github.com/byIlsa/luna/blob/master/readmecontent/userandsiteownerstories.pdf).

### Site owner goals ###

See ["User Stories"](#user-stories)

## User Requirements and Expectations ##

### Requirements ###

- Easy to navigate by using buttons
- Appealing account page with a functional overview
- Easy way to book an appointment or workshop
- Easy way to buy products
- Ability to edit and delete a bookings
- Ability to contact the site owner

### Expectations ###

- When you have booked a session, it should be easy to change or reschedule this appointment.
- To have a account page that has a clear overview of products I have bought and/or appointments I have made.
- It should be easy to book an appointment and/or shop for products.

## Design Choices ##

I have decided on a clean, but playful look and feel for this project. There are many images, short texts with read more options and video's to support the textual content.

### When and why i've diverted from the wireframes ###

WIP

### Colors ###

I have chosen the following colours I have taken from the logo to support the connection between the logo and the site itself:

WIP

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for creating a color scheme.

![Color scheme]()

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient. This way my content will be easily readable.

### Fonts ###

The fonts I’ll be using are:

WIP

Fonts are from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Icons ###

Icons used are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) The are used in moderation and match the colors and overall feel of the design.

### Structure ###

For the structure I have used [Bootstrap.](https://getbootstrap.com/)
