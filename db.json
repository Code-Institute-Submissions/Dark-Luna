    "body": "Unfortunately, the possibilities to make a clear distinction between sex work (prostitution) and the therapeutic touch of certain body parts (yoni / lingam massage) are limited and difficult to frame unambiguously. That is why I have decided not to give yoni massages for the sake of transparency and safety of both myself and the therapist and of you, the client, because I would have to apply for a prostitution permit. It hurts that this work is currently still equivalent to prostitution, but I do agree with the opinion that this type of work must take place according to unambiguous and verifiable protocols, so that the safety of the client can be guaranteed at all times. On the other hand, the therapist (and clients) must also be able to cover themselves legally, should things happen that are unacceptable. So both must be able to feel safe to serve the purpose (recovery and growth of the client). I see on many websites of people who do the same work, still widely advertised that they do offer this work. I also see one lawsuit after another in the media because things are indeed happening that are unacceptable. Unfortunately, it is also striking that these mainly concern men who treat women. There is a clear power relationship here. We are dealing here with enormously intimate work. And a mistake is easily made. Consciously or unconsciously. The therapy is not clearly discussed, save words are not agreed upon and the boundary between trying to let someone&#39;s fear work through and crossing a boundary is not easy to estimate. A traumatized client may not be able to report this properly, so that unacceptable behavior can still take place. However good the intentions may be. Unfortunately, there are many tantra masseurs who may work with the best of intentions, but may not be able to create an environment that is safe enough. The border is wafer-thin and the training courses that can lead to joining professional associations that guard these borders are virtually non-existent. A doctor is a little more guaranteed by all kinds of protocols and insurance against these kinds of charges, although you sometimes read something about it. I am afraid of my colleagues who do this oh so important work with the best of intentions. It seems more like a matter of &quot;when&quot; than &quot;if&quot; and when the thunder starts, the end is soon lost. I really want to argue in favor of vocational training that will be recognized, that can enable access to professional associations so that things like this can be prevented even more.",

    "tag": "Men",
    "author": 1,
    "body": "You are out with your man and a gorgeous woman walks by, he almost breaks his neck from following her with his eyes.\r\n\r\nYou find your man flipping through picture after picture of beautiful women on the internet while he barely notices your presence.\r\n\r\nOn the beach, you are walking hand in hand with your lover when you notice his eyes lingering on a beautiful woman’s shapely tanned body.\r\n\r\nBefore you start to get angry or feel betrayed and hurt, you may want to step back for a moment and take a better look at your man.\r\n\r\nAs frustrating as his ‘wandering eyes’ can be, there is a gift to them!\r\n\r\nThe key is to understand this natural masculine response to beauty and to take full advantage of it.\r\n\r\nWhy do his eyes wander?\r\n\r\nBefore accusing him of being unfaithful or just a plain outright pervert, you may want to peek into the motivator behind the action.\r\n\r\nTestosterone.\r\n\r\nWe love this guy, don’t we?\r\n\r\nIn fact, testosterone is responsible for that feeling of desire and is the instigator behind our libido.\r\n\r\nWithout testosterone, there would be no sexual play, no attraction, just cuddles and snuggles, but not hot, burning lust.\r\n\r\nTestosterone also is behind the sexy, strong muscles we love so much.\r\n\r\nWhat about confidence?\r\n\r\nTestosterone again! Self-confidence and assertiveness are enhanced with its presence.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t we just love a confident man who knows what he wants?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\nYet the very same hormone is initiates sexual thoughts and fantasies and increases our desire for one-night stands and affairs, as it is quite fond of novelty.\r\n\r\nWhich is where the ‘other woman’ comes in.\r\n\r\nThe unknown beauty ramps up your mans testosterone levels and before you know it, his eyes are eating her alive.\r\n\r\nThe same happens within us, albeit at levels a little less intense then an man’s.\r\n\r\nNow, testosterone has a buddy.\r\n\r\nLHRH. In fact, it is LHRH that kick starts our man’s testosterone when a gorgeous woman shows up.\r\n\r\nIt also regulates testosterone levels in his body making sure that he is always ‘ready and willing’ when a woman is available.\r\n\r\nNow here’s the catch:\r\n\r\nStress and the threat of danger can short-circuit this cyclical two-part harmony and shut down your man. The same is true for you.\r\n\r\nHere’s the deal.\r\n\r\nWhen a man’s has been in a relationship for a long time, there is often a loss of novelty, of excitement, and therefore, the loss of testosterone. \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the stress of life and feelings of being dominated or belittled dwindle a man’s testosterone levels.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the worst culprits of male castration has been the Feminist movement. Men no longer know how to be good men AND maintain their testosterone levels.\r\n\r\nHave you castrated you man? Do you hang him ‘out by the balls’?\r\n\r\nMen are remarkably sensitive creatures.\r\n\r\nTestosterone, as potent and delicious as it can be, is also phenomenally delicate and easily disrupted by external causes.\r\n\r\nAs a man ages and perhaps gains a little weight, his testosterone levels go down. When he loses, at work or socially, his levels plummet.\r\n\r\nThe lower they are, the less drive he will have, both inside and outside of the bedroom\r\n\r\nBut there’s help.\r\n\r\nBy encouraging your man’s testosterone and LHRH levels.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBefore kicking his butt down to the local gym and getting him to pump iron, you may want to consider how powerful your influence actually is.\r\n\r\nRev his motor and ride his turn on!\r\n\r\nOnce you understand that you can play a part in creating a sexy, confident, and turned on man, you may find great joy in creating new ways to titillate your man.\r\n\r\nHere are a few suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Point out hot women to him and let him know that his turn on is your turn on.\r\n\r\n2. Send him texts or emails with images of gorgeous women (that you find beautiful too).\r\n\r\n3. Write him an explicit fantasy of your own. Get wild in your story-telling and leave it on his desk-top for him to find.\r\n\r\n4. If you are game, turn yourself on and record your own sounds of pleasure. Talk to him and let him know what you are doing. Send him the recording or leave it on his voice mail.\r\n\r\nMen are both highly visual and auditory.\r\n\r\nThe more you surprise him this way, the more excited and delighted he will be. And the healthier his levels of testosterone will be.\r\n\r\nThrough gifting our man the freedom to respond to beauty, he will find a new sense of novelty within his relationship, finding us all the more attractive and desirable.",

In fact, for a long time, people have suggested that there is a connection between lunar and menstrual cycles, some myths even suggesting that fertility and lunar cycles have some sort of connection, a controversial tale.\r\n\r\nIn a separate study, also published today in  Science Advances, researchers showed that, while all of the myths surrounding this connection might not hold up, there could be some link between menstrual cycles and moon cycles. \r\n\r\nBy analyzing menstrual cycle records that 22 women kept for up to 32 years. They examined long-term data on menstrual cycle onset with data averaging a length of 15 years and including information from women both under and over age 35. They compared this data with fluctuations in the lunar cycles to see how the two lined up. \r\n\r\nThey found that, of the women who participated, those whose menstrual cycles last longer than 27 days showed \"intermittently synchronized with cycles that affect the intensity of moonlight,\" according to a statement. The team determined that this synchronization was slowly lost over time as the participants grew older, and found that the link was lessened with increased exposure to artificial light. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, they concluded that \"menstrual cycles also aligned with the tropical month (the 27.32 days it takes the moon to pass twice through the same equinox point) 13.1% of the time in women 35 years and younger and 17.7% of the time in women over 35, suggesting that menstruation is also affected by shifts in the moon’s gravimetric forces,\" according to the statement.",

    "title": "Why The Ketogenic Diet Is Great For Hormone Balance",

    "body": "Keto is the hottest diet trend. And it's no surprise! It burns fat and triggers weight loss—what's not to love about that?\r\n\r\nBut there's something else that hasn't been widely publicized: A properly executed ketogenic diet can help restore balance to out-of-whack female sex hormones. In my practice, I've also seen it mitigate weight gain, hot flashes, near-zero energy, low sex drive, bone loss, mood swings, and other troublesome symptoms associated with perimenopause, menopause, PMS, and post-menopause.\r\n\r\nIn my new book The Hormone Fix, I write about why I think it's the perfect diet for women who are going through major hormone changes or dealing with symptoms related to hormone fluctuations. As a gynecologist and women's health expert, I employ ketogenic nutrition to help women fix their hormones and keep them feeling healthy, especially as they get older. Here's how and why the ketogenic diet can come to your rescue:\r\n1. It focuses on fat for better hormone support.\r\n\r\nFat is your best friend on a ketogenic diet. On a true keto diet, roughly 75 percent of your calories should come from healthy fat sources such as avocados, nuts and seeds, coconut oil, butter, olives and olive oil, and other high-fat foods. These \"good\" fats support hormone production and maintain hormone balance because they are the building blocks for estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. For too long, we've been told to be wary of fat, and thus we slashed fat in favor of carbs. This was a mistake, and personally, I believe that this low-fat movement contributed to the hormonal challenges many women face today.\r\n2. It boosts insulin sensitivity by reducing carb intake.\r\n\r\nA keto diet restricts carbohydrates to 20 to 50 grams a day. This helps balance insulin levels. Insulin is a master hormone that controls blood sugar, and when it's too high and out of balance, your sex hormone levels can drop.\r\n\r\nLuckily, following a ketogenic diet makes your body more \"insulin sensitive.\" This means insulin is well-regulated, in balance, and used properly by your cells. A study published in 2005 in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed a ketogenic diet increased insulin sensitivity by 75 percent in obese people with diabetes. While studies have yet to be conducted on the general population, the results are still promising.\r\n\r\nWhen you're insulin sensitive, all sorts of metabolic miracles happen. You stay slim and get fit more easily; you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia; you tend to not have hot flashes or night sweats; and you rebuild your bone health so that you're less at risk for frailty and osteoporosis. Cravings become a distant memory, and you feel and look healthy and energized.\r\n3. It eases premenstrual syndrome (PMS) by detoxing the body.\r\n\r\nPMS produces a lot of really uncomfortable symptoms, including cramps, cravings, moodiness, irritability, depression, acne, and fatigue. The underlying cause is often estrogen dominance, or having too much estrogen and not enough progesterone. One of the causes of estrogen dominance is a diet comprised of too much sugar and refined carbohydrates—a problem easily eliminated by going on a ketogenic diet.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of estrogen dominance is exposure to estrogens in the environment. These are toxic forms of estrogen that not only worsen PMS symptoms, but they are through to increase the risk of breast cancer, endometriosis, fertility struggles, and autoimmune diseases. If you opt for a primarily plant-based keto diet, you're encouraged to eat foods that detoxify these nasty estrogens like veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and greens and delicious herbs and spices like oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, and turmeric.\r\n4. It boosts reproductive health by combating PCOS.\r\n\r\nOne of the main causes of fertility struggles in women is polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. This condition develops from poorly balanced sex hormones, and more than half of the women diagnosed with PCOS are obese or overweight, have poor blood sugar regulation, and have insulin resistance. There's no cure for PCOS, but because insulin problems are associated with PCOS, a ketogenic diet is a viable solution. Duke University researchers found that women with PCOS who followed a keto diet were able to balance their levels of insulin and testosterone and experience improvements in weight, fertility problems, and menstruation among other factors. Two women in the study got pregnant despite previous trouble getting pregnant, and everyone lost weight.\r\n5. It zaps stress to protect the adrenals.\r\n\r\nIn response to life's many stressors, the adrenal glands release the hormone cortisol to galvanize energy so we can react quickly to whatever challenge we're facing. If our stress goes unresolved, the adrenals keep pumping out cortisol, resulting in too much cortisol floating around. The ongoing secretion of high amounts of cortisol robs your body of progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone, and if this keeps happening, you're more likely to experience imbalanced sex hormones, high blood sugar, loss of muscle, low sex drive, and burnout.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, enjoy all those low-carbohydrate vegetables you typically eat on a ketogenic diet (plenty of green leafy vegetables, parsley, kale, beet greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and so forth). They may help normalize cortisol, support your adrenal glands, and improve your natural progesterone levels.\r\n\r\nThe keto diet isn't for everyone, but for a lot of women in my practice it's been a game-changer for hormonal imbalance and hormone-related symptoms. If you're suffering or just not feeling your best, the keto diet is definitely worth a try!",

    "author": 1,
    "body": "Thousands of women around the world have told me again and again that for much of their lives they looked to outside “experts” for answers. They thought these people (most often men) must know more – and better – than they do.\r\n\r\nBut of course! Isn’t that the way it is for a reason? There is a multi-billion dollar industry dedicated to telling women they are wrong and need to be fixed and that the solutions lie outside of themselves.\r\n\r\nHow could a multi-billion dollar industry be wrong?\r\n\r\nLet that sink in for a moment…\r\n\r\nThere is a multi-billion dollar industry profiting from your insecurity; from your doubt and distrust of yourself. The lies this industry spews about women: who you should be, who you shouldn’t be, what you should do, what you shouldn’t do, are so pervasive. They can feel like the water you swim in: just the way it is.\r\n\r\nBut I’m here to tell you THIS IS NOT JUST THE WAY IT IS.\r\n\r\nThese lies have domesticated women and disconnected us from our own inherent genius within.\r\n\r\nI say NO MORE! No more buying these lies. No more allowing ourselves to be tamed and trained to be smaller, controllable versions of ourselves.\r\n\r\nBeautiful you, is it time you say NO MORE to these lies? NO MORE to being domesticated? No more to suppressing your greatness?\r\n\r\nIf so, congratulations. I celebrate your choice! By saying NO MORE to the lies you are also saying YES to yourself.\r\n\r\nAs you move forward from here it’s important to know the 3 signs that you are domesticated. When you can spot these signs in your own life, you begin to see the “water” you’ve been swimming in. This is the first step to rewilding yourself.\r\n\r\n3 Signs You’re Domesticated:\r\n\r\n    You defer to outside authorities on issues related to your body, your finances, your worth, your pleasure, your sexuality.\r\n    You believe you are not good enough, woman enough, sexy enough, feminine enough, complete enough, orgasmic enough.\r\n    You think you need to be perfect: the perfect sexual partner, the perfect wife, the perfect mom, the perfect Board member, the perfect everything.\r\n\r\nSo, take a moment for an honest, loving, reality check with yourself.\r\n\r\nHow often do you defer to outside authorities? How much of your life have you spent obsessing with being good enough and being perfect?\r\n\r\nBe kind with yourself. This is not the time for judging yourself. The domestication of women has rested on the power of being able to judge and shame you. So you get to be bigger than that, kinder than that. The only way to change this cycle of judgment is to stop the judgment.\r\n\r\nHow do you do this? Acknowledge that you’ve been domesticated and that you are choosing to change this. Don’t waste time or energy on judging what has been. Instead, set your sights to what is ahead…\r\n\r\nThere is so much inherent genius in your body, in your feminine psyche, in your pleasure. The only way to free yourself from domestication is to rewild yourself. And the only way to rewild yourself and free your greatness from suppression is to come home to yourself.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n~ Instead of looking outside yourself for answers, choose to be your own authority.\r\n\r\n~ Instead of believing you are not enough, begin to love yourself into wholeness.\r\n\r\n~ Instead of trying to be some perfect version of what others think you should be, begin to explore your authentic, true self within.\r\n\r\nComing home to yourself, to your true self, is the biggest gift you can give yourself. To support you in this journey, I invite you to join me on Saturday, April 29th for a free webinar as we dive deeper into this topic of rewilding ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember: You deserve to be free and wild. It is your birthright and the only way that your authentic self can know true pleasure and fulfillment.",
