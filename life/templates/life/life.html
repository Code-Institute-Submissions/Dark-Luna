                Coaching at Dark Luna is a different kind of coaching than you may be used to. In coaching, many people often mistakenly mean digging for hours into someone's past.
                As a result, you feel even worse about things that you were already uncomfortable with. Dark Luna has come up with a unique concept where you only speak briefly about the past.
                What happened in the past can contain a lot of information, but no more than that. It is nice to know where you come from and to use this as a kind of springboard.
                This is information that can help you avoid falling into the same pattern again. Coaching at Dark Luna can help you in a variety of areas.
                We master several forms of therapy and decide what form(s) would benefit you best, depending on what you bring to the table. 
                We work with Somatic Therapy, energy healing and shadow work.
