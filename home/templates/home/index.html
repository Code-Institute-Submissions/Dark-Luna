            “Today I celebrate women who are:<br />
            Vulnerable but strong.
            Sensitive but assertive.
            Always learning but intelligent.
            Scared but brave.
            Victims but survivors.
            Helpless but selfless.
            Heartbroken but healers.
            Women who break glass-ceilings & barriers.
            I see you. I am with you. I am you.”
            ― Mitta Xinindlu

                In a world where porn still seems to be the prime example, more and more women are feeling lost. Sex
                seems to follow a fixed pattern, telling your partner what you like and what you dislike seems an
                impossible task,
                since we have never learned that we also have a voice. Having the right to tailor our sexual
                relationships, with others, but also with ourselves, as it nourishes ourselves.
                It is easy to blame men for this, but they too live by examples presented to them.
                If we, as women, want to receive and give pleasure, it is our task to provide the examples that are more
                in line with the image we envision with the word ‘sex’.
                In order to receive, a degree of security and self-knowledge is necessary.

                Knowledge of the unique qualities of one's own body, which the body needs to fully open up, is something
                that few women have mastered.
                Dark Luna wants to help women to reconnect with their own body in order to discover what it takes to be
                able to fully open yourself up for sex, in all its beautiful facets.
                The lack of knowledge in this regard does not only manifest itself in the sexual field.
                Luna is convinced that many problems that women experience in life in general (who am I actually, what
                do I need in this life, why do I get stuck in specific areas or a general sense of meaninglessness),
                menstruation and / or fertility problems, stems from having no or little connection and awareness of the
                body.
                Luna offers a unique perspective on how to deal with these problems. And learn how to work with your
                body again, instead of against your body. Your body is a beautiful being, able to guide you on this path
                that is life.
